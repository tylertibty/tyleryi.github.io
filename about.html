                The way that you are able to create something such as a robot that moves and can perform tasks from just pieces of metal and lines of code is amazing, and I love the feeling when I accomplish a goal and something operates well. This is what drives me in my activities such as being on the robotics team.

                I care about using technology and enhancing the human experience, as well as teaching people how to navigate this new digitalized world. I hope to solve the issue of lack of technological knowledge. I hope to set up a group or club to educate newer generations about coding and other technology based activities.

                After one season in the VEX robotics competition, I have found myself wanting to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering. This is because when I first started working on my robot, I had no idea what to do. My school had no mentors and limited resources, and so it was difficult to get started. However, as the season went on I would indulge myself in researching different mechanisms and the usage of them. I found it fascinating that these mechanisms could be put together in different ways and that a certain method could optimize the capability of it. On top of it all, what I enjoy most about mechanical engineering is the ability to view the action and the end result. Counter to coding, for example, one is unable to really see and understand the end result and the process of it. In addition to that, I enjoy the tactile view of something rather than a 2D rendering on my computer. After university, my goal is to start my own company which is most likely ce​​ered around making robots for certain industries.

                Aside from all of the STEM interests, I have other hobbies such as photography, piano, and polo. Wow three hobbies that start with the letter P! Another thing that I like to do is learn Japanese on Duolingo.
